# Introduction
This project contains Web Components built using Stencil.  
The goal is to provide simple components without dependencies of other Frontend frameworks such as Angular, React or VueJS.  
All of them are using only plain HTML and CSS and it is possible to use them in any project because Web Components are framework agnostic.
